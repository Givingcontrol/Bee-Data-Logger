## Write to SD card then go to sleep

This code shows how to write data to the SD card and then go into DeepSleep.

this can be useful for long term data logging as you can take a data reading, save it to the SD card and then go to sleep for a pre-determined amount of time to save battery life. 

In DeepSleep the Bee Data Logger uses about 20uA of quiescent current.
