## Using the RTC

This code shows how to setup and use the RTC.

the first time you setup the RTC you'll need to manually set the date and time and once its set it will hold that time until the RTC loses a power source.

attach the included CR1220 coin cell holder so the RTC never loses its time even if the board is unplugged or put into deepsleep.
