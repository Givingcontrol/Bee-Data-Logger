## LiPo Battery Voltage Monitoring

This code shows the voltage of a connected 1S LiPo battery. This can be useful for monitoring the battery life on battery operated projects.

Note: if you have no lipo plugged in but run this code it will give a 4.0+ v reading off the usb. plug in a lipo battery and the voltage will change to lipos voltage. (if its around 4v you wont see a change but it will be reading the lipos voltage.)
